# SDL2 Tutorial Examples

These simple Crystal programs are adapted from the tutorials found at
<http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php>. They each demonstrate a feature
of SDL and how to implement it using the Crystal bindings for SDL2. To help
you understand them, comments have been added to explain why each portion is
necessary.

These examples require some images and fonts from the tutorials which aren't
included in the repository. In order to run the examples you will need to
download and extract the files for each example you intend to run and place them
under `samples/data`. To ensure you don't commit them, that folder has been
added to `.gitignore`.
